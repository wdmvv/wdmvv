I write code. More or less interesting projects:<br>
<ul>
  <li> [spot-on](https://github.com/wdmvv/spot-on) - cli tool for downloading albums/playlists from spotify</li>
  <li> [spotgone](https://github.com/wdmvv/spotgone) - same as spot-on but in go (it is more beautiful and more clean)</li>
  <li> [tierlist](https://github.com/wdmvv/tierlist) - tool for creating text based tierlists in console of your choice (technically not only console, depends on how you intend on using it :^) )</li>
</ul>
