I write code. I like go and python, intend on learning ts/elixir in the foreseeable future. More or less interesting projects:<br>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/wdmvv/spot-on">spot-on</a> - cli tool for downloading albums/playlists from spotify</li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/wdmvv/spotgone">spotgone</a> - same as spot-on but in go (it is more beautiful and more clean)</li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/wdmvv/tierlist">tierlist</a> - tool for creating text based tierlists in console of your choice (technically not only console, depends on how you intend on using it :^) )</li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/wdmvv/wikibfs">wikibfs</a> - ever wondered how far wiki articles are (how many articles you have to visit to go from the start to the end)? this repo will answer your question!</li>
</ul>
